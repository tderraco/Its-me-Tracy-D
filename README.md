Portfolio

This is my Portfolio. It was a big challenge for me but I was able to complete about half of it due to time. I learned to code an entire page and add CSS styling to it. It took a lot of effort and long nights to get as far as I did. The most challenging part of this project was the box styling. I had a hard time creating a box for the images and a tough time figuring out the flex box commmands. I am really proud of what I have accomplished in the last week. I  have never done this before so I am pleased with the outcome, but I do plan on resubmitting this project so that I can get more practice and get the page perfect!
